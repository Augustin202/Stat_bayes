## Results

### Plot 1

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png)<!-- -->

We plot the histograms of the empirical means of q by values of s and
R2y. The red line represents s/k. The blue line represents the mean of
the empirical means. We use a log10 scale for the x axis.

### Plot 2

We plot the histograms of the empirical means of q by values of s and
R2y. The red line represents s/k. The blue line represents the mean of
the empirical means. We use a log10 scale for the x axis.
